The Art Dealer Game - User Manual

Overview
The Art Dealer Game is an interactive educational simulation developed to help
students in grades K–8 enhance their computational thinking and pattern recognition
skills. It presents players with a deck of cards and challenges them to discover hidden
patterns through a fun and intuitive interface. The game supports two students playing together and includes audio prompts and assessment tracking.

5. Observe what the art dealer (the AI) buys (indicated by the software's pattern
recognition).
6. The current student's turn is displayed at the bottom of the screen.
7. Click Submit Guess to see if the four cards follow the dealer's secret pattern.
8. You have 3 attempts to identify the correct pattern per round (students take turns).

Game Objectives by Grade Level
K–2:
 Identify simple patterns: all red cards, all black cards, same suit, or same rank.
Grades 3–5:
 More complex rules: prime-number values, cards that sum to a specific number
(e.g., 9), or specific combinations.
Grades 6–8:
 Advanced logic: poker-style hands, value combinations (e.g., value = 21), or
sequence-based logic.

 Color-coded cards
 Simple interface suitable for young learners
 Audio prompts and feedback
 Two-student collaborative mode
 Assessment tracking and learning outcomes

Troubleshooting
